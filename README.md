Analysis of 2012-2014 field radiocarbon data from Barrow, AK

Data used in this analysis are stored in the NGEE-Arctic data repository, and can be accessed at http://dx.doi.org/10.5440/1364062

Description of files:

(1) surface_chamber_atm_correction.Rmd corrects raw radiocarbon measurements from static chambers for background atmosphere contamination

(2) chamber_14C_plots generates plots of ecosystem respiration rates and radiocarbon contents

(3) C13endmember_names.rds is a vector of plot IDs with CO2 concentrations greater than 10x atmosphere
